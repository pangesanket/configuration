benefits of terrraform 

---:> better cost management:
    resources, environment and complex infrastructure can be easily created and destroyed 
    Automation considerably frees up the time of developers and infrastructure maintainers
    Tagging stratagies requirements can be easily implemented across entire infrastructure 
    It becomes much easier to obtain an overview of all resources created by a specific IaC project.

----> Improved reliability 
    Well developed IaC tools guarantee a consistent behavior. 
    IaC tools provide multiple ways of deploying configurations: locally, as part of a CI/CD pipeline ,triggered via API calls .
    IaC tools validate infrastructure  configuration as part of the deployment process.

----> Improved consistency and scalability 
    Infrastructure can be easily copied and deployed, multiple times with the same structure
    Modules can be created and made publicly or privately available 
    Different environment can be created based on the same / similar configuration files.
    Resources counts can be easily increased or decreased when needed.

-----> Improved deployment process 
-----> fewer human errors 
----> improved security stratagies 
----> self documenting infrastructure
